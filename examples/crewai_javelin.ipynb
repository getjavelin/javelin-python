    "## Javelin Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API Keys**: Javelin provides an API key (`x-api-key`) to authenticate the requests.\n",
    "- **Javelin Route**: Defines the specific route to a task or flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calling CrewwAI via Javelin:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CrewwAI** utilizes Javelin’s routes to send and manage requests.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Flow Definition**: CrewwAI uses the Javelin API to define agents (e.g., market analyst, strategist) and their corresponding tasks.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Task Execution**: Each agent, when triggered via the route, will execute the specific task as per the flow defined in CrewwAI.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Flow Management**: CrewwAI listens to each agent’s output and triggers the next step or task, ensuring smooth workflow orchestration.\n"
